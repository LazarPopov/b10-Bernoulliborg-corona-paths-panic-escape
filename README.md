# b10-Nijenborgh-panic-escape
Simulation of an escape of a panicked crowd from the Nijenborgh's ground floor. Determining and solving bottlenecks

To run the program:
  - Download MatLab R2015A (no later version due to the program relying an older version of matlab)
  - Download all the files.
  - Run PanicSimulator.m
To use the program:
  - in the menu bar multiple options are given:
    *  you can edit the arena
    *  you can automatically run multiple simulations (currently not working)
    *  you can change settings, in settings you can chose the parameters of the panic + you can chose different environments.
  - To run the nijenborgh simulations: go to settings  -> positions on reset -> chose the file rwallsagent.m from the maps folder
                                                       -> Wall positions on reset -> chose the file rwalls.m from the maps folder. (it will take some time to load due to the large map)
